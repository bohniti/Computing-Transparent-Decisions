	abstract = {Explaining complex or seemingly simple machine learning models is a practical
	and ethical question, as well as a legal issue. Can I trust the model? Is it
	biased? Can I explain it to others? We want to explain individual predictions
	from a complex machine learning model by learning simple, interpretable
	explanations. Of existing work on interpreting complex models, Shapley values
	is regarded to be the only model-agnostic explanation method with a solid
	theoretical foundation. Kernel SHAP is a computationally efficient
	approximation to Shapley values in higher dimensions. Like several other
	existing methods, this approach assumes independent features, which may give
	very wrong explanations. This is the case even if a simple linear model is used
	for predictions. We extend the Kernel SHAP method to handle dependent features.
	We provide several examples of linear and non-linear models with linear and
	non-linear feature dependence, where our method gives more accurate
	approximations to the true Shapley values. We also propose a method for

	abstract = {We present Asirra, a CAPTCHA that asks users to identify cats out of a set of 12 photographs of both cats and dogs. Asirra is easy for users; user studies indicate it can be solved by humans 99.6% of the time in under 30 seconds. Barring a major advance in machine vision, we expect computers will have no better than a 1/54,000 chance of solving it. Asirra’s image database is provided by a novel, mutually beneficial partnership with Petfinder.com. In exchange for the use of their three million images, we display an "adopt me" link beneath each one, promoting Petfinder’s primary mission of finding homes for homeless animals. We describe the design of Asirra, discuss threats to its security, and report early deployment experiences. We also describe two novel algorithms for amplifying the skill gap between humans and computers that can be used on many existing CAPTCHAs.},
