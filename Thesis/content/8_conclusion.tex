\label{ch:conclusion}
Even the opportunities are great which were provided by explainable \gls{dl} Models, an upload filter as it is mentioned in the introduction is still not possible. More research is necessary to ensure a higher interpretability. Even though the prototype leaves much room for more advanced and clear \gls{xai} Models. Moreover a realistic scenario with more classes provides a much petter picture of how far can transparency be developed.  \\

Modern technique companies face a tough challenge since the amount of data which got uploaded to there platforms got more and more. 
So it is in their response to check if new technologies can help us and to save our privacy while not harming the business opportunities which get established in the last years.\\

Instead of implementing new algorithms, those companies should at least try if \gls{xai}, \gls{dl} to explain their algorithms. Even though, more research is needed to give an intuitive interpretation of deep learning decision boundaries this thesis had shown that with just a few lines of code, a deep learning model could be made more transparent. \\

I hope that I can be  part of development of more transparent \gls{dl} Models and so I will focus at least a few more times on this topic, while I'm participating at the master in computer science. My goal is to implement even more of those methods to find out if they could help humans to understand deep learning models. So, probably we can all participate in the significant opportunities which were provided from those machine learning algorithms.\\
